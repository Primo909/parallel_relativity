### Explanation

This C++ code solves the wave equation $\Box \phi = 0$ and is parallelized with MPI. It can solve the current state of the field at a given steps in time and generate an animation, it can perform a point convergence and a norm convergence test of the code.  There are some example scripts in the section Examples which explain how to do this. Making and running the C++ code as is, will run the simulation and only write some basic information and the elapsed time to the terminal. This is done with

```shell
user:dir$ make parallel_main.exe
user:dir$ mpiexec -np 4 ./bin/parallel_main.exe 2000 0 0
```

The command will run on 4 cores and divide the space into 2000 points. Different initial conditions and time discretizations can be changed in the C++ code. The last two zeros are necessary arguments which suppress saving of the solution of the equation and the running of the point convergence test respectively.


### CODE RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS:

Build and run code in main folder with
```shell
user:dir$ make parallel_main.exe
user:dir$ mpiexec -np numberOfCores ./bin/parallel_main.exe NumberOfCells Saving PointConvTest
```

The last two arguments are bools which activate (1) or deactivate (0) the saving of files for an animation or the execution of the point convergence test respectively.

### Examples
Run example scripts that generate an animation of the solution of the wave equation or that perform a point convergence test.

#### Animation

```shell
user:dir$ bash animation.sh
```

* T = 2
* N = 3000
* dt = 1E-4

#### Point convergence Test

```shell
user:dir$ bash pointConvTest.sh
```



* T = 1.2
* N_low = 400
* N_mid = 800
* N_high = 1600
* dt = 1E-4
